# Five dials in the endogenous-news block have never been varied in
# seventy-five rounds: news_market_weight, news_sector_weight,
# news_peer_weight, news_peer_weight_down and news_peer_vix_coupling. Only
# endogenous_news_sigma and endogenous_news_intensity have ever moved.
#
# One of the five is the shape crisis co-movement has been asking for since
# round 59. Peer contagion runs at
#
#   weight = news_peer_weight * (1 + news_peer_vix_coupling * crisis_spike)
#
# and crisis_spike is ZERO below crisis_vix_threshold. So the coupling moves
# cross-sectional correlation INSIDE crisis windows and cannot touch a calm
# market at any setting.
#
# That matters because of the standing problem: every dial that moves crisis
# co-movement's LEVEL widens its across-block RANGE, since they all work
# through variance and variance is what the range is made of. pt-v12's range
# is 0.0551 and fits the 0.0630 band; pt-v14's is 0.0769 and does not.
# crisis_blend_source was the only dial found to narrow it and managed 12%,
# a third of what is needed. This channel is not a variance channel at all --
# it is information contagion between peers, gated on the crisis spike.
#
# It is live, not dormant: news_peer_weight is 0.05, so a coupling of 8 has
# been acting in every crisis this programme has simulated, unvaried and
# unmeasured.
#
# np00..np24 sweep the coupling with everything else at pt-v14. pw02..pw12
# move the peer WEIGHT instead, which scales the calm component too -- the
# control that separates "crisis gating matters" from "more contagion
# matters". Four blocks spanning the co-movement range so both band edges
# are tested.
