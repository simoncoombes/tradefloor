# GARCH persistence -- market_vol_alpha + market_vol_beta -- turns out to
# be the master dial, and it has a WINDOW. Over 37 vectors with five or
# more blocks it correlates +0.85 with the crisis co-movement spread, where
# market_vol_beta alone manages +0.45; s23n01 has a HIGHER beta than s23
# and a 30% tighter spread, so beta cannot be the driver.
#
# On the nine confirmation blocks, sorted by persistence:
#
#   0.953-0.966   co-mov sd 0.0150-0.0167   out 1/9   lever 0.045-0.106
#   0.9694 lh16   co-mov sd 0.0172          out 1/9   lever 0.0178
#   0.971-0.975   co-mov sd 0.019 -0.023    out 3/9   lever 0.019-0.031
#   0.985-0.989   co-mov sd 0.031 -0.035    out 9/9   lever 0.14 -0.20
#
# Below about 0.967 the crisis lever breaks. Above about 0.970 the
# co-movement spread breaks. lh16 sits inside that window at 0.9694 and is
# the only vector of eighteen that clears the bar on those blocks -- and it
# got there by accident, since nothing had ever swept persistence directly.
# pt-v12 sits at 0.9631, just below the window, which is consistent with it
# having the worst lever error of any candidate measured.
#
# So: sweep the window. Six persistences from 0.960 to 0.974 crossed with
# three garch couplings, all built from lh16 and keeping its alpha/beta
# split so that ONLY the persistence moves. Seven blocks spanning pt-v12's
# whole co-movement range, so a candidate is tested against both edges.
