# The one combination crisis co-movement has never been given.
#
# To pass every block a candidate needs its across-block RANGE inside the
# 0.0630 band AND its mean centred. pt-v12 has the range (0.0551) and misses
# the centre by +0.026; pt-v14 has the centre (+0.002) and a range of 0.0769.
# Neither has both, and four mechanisms have now closed trying to give one
# of them the other: the persistence window, the source walk, the
# source/sector pair, and peer contagion.
#
# Round 58 measured what governs the range -- GARCH persistence, rho +0.85 --
# and also that persistence sets the crisis lever on a U-curve with its
# minimum at 0.9694. pt-v12 sits at 0.9631 with a tight range and the worst
# lever measured; pt-v14 at 0.9728 with the best lever and a wide range.
#
# But that sweep moved persistence with the VIX couplings HELD FIXED. It
# measured one slice through the space, not the frontier. If the lever can
# be bought back at low persistence by re-tuning the VIX transfer, the range
# and the lever stop trading against each other.
#
# market_vol_vix_anchor is the natural compensator: it sets where the
# variance target equals baseline, and the fragility probe in round 65 found
# it one of the three dials with the strongest grip on the lever -- which is
# exactly what makes it able to pay for one.
#
# Four persistences from pt-v12's 0.9631 to pt-v14's 0.9728, crossed with
# four anchors. Four blocks spanning the co-movement range so both band
# edges are tested and the RANGE is measurable rather than inferred.
