# crisis_blend_variance_damp, measured for the first time.
#
# Round 79 established the binding trade: crisis co-movement's across-block
# RANGE is bought with 504-day panel blocks, mediated by GARCH persistence.
# A 4x4 grid over persistence and the VIX anchor found no cell escaping it --
# every vector that tightened the range gave up panel blocks, and pt-v14
# sits at the panel-optimal end.
#
# The mechanism behind that: at a held VIX the crisis spike is pinned at
# crisis_blend_cap, so the only thing varying between seed blocks in the
# crisis injection is the market factor's MAGNITUDE -- the variance level,
# which persistence governs. The dial scales the injection by
# |factor/baseline|^-d, so at 1.0 the crisis correlation it produces stops
# inheriting the variance level.
#
# The test is NOT whether the range falls. Lowering persistence already does
# that. It is whether the range falls WITHOUT the panel falling with it --
# whether the two are actually decoupled or merely re-parameterised again,
# which is what happened to the anchor in round 79.
#
# Three arms:
#   d2..d10     the damp alone on pt-v14
#   v12d4,v12d8 the damp on pt-v12, because a mechanism that only helps one
#               vector is a coincidence rather than a mechanism
#   d*p97*      the damp paired with RAISED persistence, the direction round
#               79 says buys panel blocks -- if the damp supplies the range,
#               persistence is free to go the other way
#
# Four blocks spanning the co-movement distribution so the range is measured
# rather than inferred, and both band edges are tested.
